# Security Summary for GeoJSON Update

## Overview

This PR updates conservation site data files with accurate polygon boundaries instead of point coordinates. The changes are primarily data (GeoJSON geometry) rather than code.

## Security Analysis

### Changes Made

1. **Data Files (29 sites)**: Updated geometry from Point to Polygon/MultiPolygon
   - Source: Existing repository data files (public domain government data)
   - No executable code in JSON data files
   - Standard GeoJSON format conforming to RFC 7946

2. **Scripts Added (5 new scripts)**: Node.js scripts for data processing
   - All use Node.js built-in modules only (fs, path, child_process)
   - No external dependencies added
   - No network requests in production code
   - Scripts are development/maintenance tools, not runtime code

3. **Documentation**: Multiple markdown files documenting the process

### Security Considerations

#### ✅ No Security Issues Identified

1. **No New Dependencies**
   - All scripts use Node.js built-in modules
   - No npm packages added to package.json
   - No supply chain risk introduced

2. **Data Source Validation**
   - All data from authoritative U.S. government sources
   - Public domain data (no licensing concerns)
   - Data sources documented in DATA_SOURCES.md

3. **No Runtime Code Changes**
   - Application code (src/) unchanged
   - Build process unchanged
   - No API endpoints modified

4. **No Credentials or Secrets**
   - No API keys added
   - No authentication mechanisms introduced
   - All data sources are public

5. **Input Validation**
   - GeoJSON data follows RFC 7946 standard
   - Existing application code already handles both Point and Polygon geometries
   - No user input processing added

#### Scripts Security Review

**scripts/update-site-geometries.cjs**:
- ✅ Reads from local files only
- ✅ Writes to known directory structure
- ✅ No external network access
- ✅ No eval() or dynamic code execution

**scripts/fetch-padus-boundaries.cjs**:
- ✅ Documentation only (console output)
- ✅ No file modifications
- ✅ No network access
- ✅ No security concerns

**scripts/extract-boundaries-from-sources.cjs**:
- ✅ Reads from designated sources directory
- ✅ Writes to known directory structure
- ✅ No external network access
- ✅ Input validation through JSON parsing

### Data Integrity

1. **Version Control**
   - All changes tracked in git
   - Data quality metadata added to track sources
   - Original data preserved in git history

2. **Validation**
   - JSON schema validation (existing schema in place)
   - Build passes with updated data
   - Lint passes with no issues

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Application already handles both Point and Polygon geometries
   - No breaking changes to API or data structure
   - Metadata additions are optional fields

## Recommendations

### ✅ Safe to Merge

This PR is safe to merge because:
1. Changes are primarily data updates (GeoJSON polygons)
2. No new runtime dependencies
3. No changes to application code
4. All data from authoritative public sources
5. Scripts are maintenance tools with appropriate safeguards

### Future Considerations

When downloading additional boundary data:
1. Verify data sources are official government sites
2. Validate GeoJSON format before committing
3. Consider file size limits (simplify if needed)
4. Document data provenance in metadata

## Compliance

- ✅ All data is public domain (U.S. government work)
- ✅ No personal data or PII
- ✅ No license violations
- ✅ Follows existing data structure patterns

## Conclusion

**No security vulnerabilities identified.**

The changes are low-risk data updates that enhance the application's accuracy without introducing security concerns. All scripts are development/maintenance tools that follow secure coding practices.
