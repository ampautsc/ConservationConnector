# Pull Request Summary: Update GeoJSON Accuracy

## Problem

All 79 conservation site files were added with Point geometry (center coordinates only) instead of accurate polygon boundaries representing the actual area boundaries. This made the visualization less accurate and didn't reflect the true extent of conservation areas.

## Solution

Updated conservation site JSON files with accurate polygon/multipolygon boundaries from authoritative government data sources.

## Results

### ✅ Completed: 29 of 79 sites (37%)

#### Phase 1: National Parks (19 sites)
- Updated with polygon boundaries from existing `us-national-parks-polygons.geojson`
- Data source: National Park Service via PADUS 3.0
- Includes: Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Everglades, Denali, and 14 others
- Data quality: High

#### Phase 2: Missouri Sites (10 sites)
- Updated with polygon boundaries from existing `mo-conservation-polygons.geojson`
- Data source: PADUS 3.0 Missouri Dataset
- Includes: Mark Twain NF, Big Muddy NWR, Ozark NSR, wilderness areas
- Data quality: High

### ⏳ Remaining: 50 sites (63%)

Ready to be updated once external data is downloaded:
- 31 National Forests (need USFS boundaries)
- 11 Wildlife Refuges (need USFWS boundaries)
- 8 Other designations (need NPS/PADUS data)

**All infrastructure is in place** - scripts and documentation are ready to process the remaining sites.

## Technical Changes

### Data Files Modified (29 sites)

Example transformation:
```json
// Before (Point geometry)
{
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-119.5383, 37.8651]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "dataQuality": "medium"
  }
}

// After (Polygon geometry)
{
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[[/* 200+ coordinate pairs */]]]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "dataQuality": "high",
    "geometrySource": "National Park Service via PADUS 3.0",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-10-17"
  }
}
```

### Scripts Added (5 scripts)

1. **update-site-geometries.cjs** - Updates National Park sites
2. **update-missouri-from-polygons.cjs** - Updates Missouri sites
3. **fetch-padus-boundaries.cjs** - Documents data requirements
4. **extract-boundaries-from-sources.cjs** - Processes downloaded boundary data
5. **update-missouri-sites.cjs** - Alternative Missouri updater (requires ogr2ogr)

### Documentation Added (6 files)

1. **DATA_SOURCES.md** - Comprehensive guide to data sources
2. **BOUNDARY_DATA_NEEDED.md** - Specific requirements for remaining 50 sites
3. **GEOJSON_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed progress summary
4. **REVIEW_NOTES.md** - Instructions for reviewers
5. **SECURITY_SUMMARY.md** - Security analysis
6. **PR_SUMMARY.md** - This file
7. **public/data/geojson/sources/README.md** - Data processing guide

## Quality Assurance

### ✅ Testing Passed

```bash
npm run lint   # ✓ No errors
npm run build  # ✓ Built successfully
```

### ✅ Manual Verification

- Geometry updates verified for sample sites
- Coordinates checked against known boundaries
- File sizes reasonable (1-50 KB per site)
- Metadata correctly updated

### ✅ Backward Compatibility

- Application code unchanged (src/ directory)
- Existing code already handles both Point and Polygon geometries
- No breaking changes to data structure
- All fields remain optional

## Security

### ✅ No Security Concerns

- No new dependencies added
- No runtime code changes
- All data from official government sources (public domain)
- No credentials or secrets
- Scripts are maintenance tools only

See SECURITY_SUMMARY.md for detailed analysis.

## File Size Impact

| Category | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 19 National Parks | ~7 KB | ~450 KB |
| 10 Missouri Sites | ~4 KB | ~450 KB |
| 50 Remaining Sites | ~18 KB | ~18 KB |
| **Total** | **~29 KB** | **~918 KB** |

**After completing all 79 sites**: Estimated 1.5-2 MB total (acceptable for web delivery)

## Data Quality Tracking

All updated sites now include enhanced metadata:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "dataQuality": "high",        // was "medium" or "low"
    "geometrySource": "...",       // new field
    "lastUpdated": "2025-10-17"    // updated
  }
}
```

**Quality Levels**:
- **high**: Accurate polygon boundaries from authoritative sources (29 sites)
- **medium**: Approximate boundaries (0 sites currently)
- **low**: Point coordinates only (50 sites remaining)

## Next Steps

### For Reviewers

See [REVIEW_NOTES.md](REVIEW_NOTES.md) for detailed instructions.

**Options**:
1. **Merge as-is** (37% complete) and create follow-up issue for remaining 50 sites
2. **Download data files** and complete remaining sites (see instructions)
3. **Request team assistance** to download and process boundary data

### For Completing Remaining Sites

```bash
# 1. Download boundary data (see BOUNDARY_DATA_NEEDED.md)
wget [USFS National Forest boundaries]
wget [USFWS Wildlife Refuge boundaries]

# 2. Place in sources directory
mv *.geojson public/data/geojson/sources/

# 3. Run extraction script
node scripts/extract-boundaries-from-sources.cjs

# 4. Verify and commit
npm run build
git add public/data/sites/*.json
git commit -m "Update remaining 50 sites with accurate boundaries"
```

## Benefits

### Immediate Benefits (29 sites complete)

1. **Accuracy**: Accurate polygon boundaries instead of approximate circles
2. **Visualization**: True representation of conservation area extents
3. **Data Quality**: High-quality data from authoritative sources
4. **Traceability**: Metadata tracks data source and quality

### Future Benefits (when complete)

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 79 sites with accurate boundaries
2. **Analysis**: Enable accurate gap analysis and connectivity studies
3. **Integration**: Better integration with GIS tools and mapping services
4. **Maintenance**: Easy to update or add new sites with existing scripts
