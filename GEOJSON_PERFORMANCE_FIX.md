# GeoJSON Performance Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem Statement

The repository contained very large PADUS3 source files that were causing performance and storage issues:
- `PADUS3_0Designation_StateMO.json` - 9.5 MB
- `PADUS3_0Easement_StateMO.json` - 7.1 MB  
- `PADUS3_0Proclamation_StateMO.json` - 3.9 MB
- **Total**: ~20.5 MB of source data

These files were committed to the repository, increasing repo size and potentially causing slow clone/checkout times.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Files Were Source Data, Not Application Data**: The PADUS3 files are source files that are NOT loaded by the application.

2. **Application Only Loads Simplified Files**: The application (`src/components/ConservationMap.jsx`) only loads:
   - `us-national-parks-polygons.geojson` (2.1 MB) - Already simplified
   - Individual site files (small, ~500 bytes each)
   - Does NOT load the PADUS3 source files

3. **Files Should Not Be in Repository**: According to best practices and the existing `.gitignore` pattern, source files should be excluded from version control.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `.gitignore`

Added pattern to exclude PADUS3 source files:
```gitignore
# PADUS3 source files (large files used to generate simplified versions)
public/data/geojson/PADUS3_*.json
```

### 2. Removed Large Source Files

Removed the following files from the repository:
- `public/data/geojson/PADUS3_0Designation_StateMO.json`
- `public/data/geojson/PADUS3_0Easement_StateMO.json`
- `public/data/geojson/PADUS3_0Proclamation_StateMO.json`

**Impact**: Repository size reduced by ~20.5 MB

### 3. Updated Documentation

Updated `public/data/geojson/README.md` to clarify:
- PADUS3 source files are NOT included in the repository
- They are only needed if regenerating or modifying the simplified files
- Use `scripts/fetch-padus-boundaries.cjs` to download them if needed

## Files Kept in Repository

The following processed/simplified files remain in the repository and are ready for use:

1. **us-national-parks-polygons.geojson** (2.1 MB)
   - 62 features
   - 97.3% size reduction from original (74.19 MB → 2.1 MB)
   - 97.4% coordinate reduction (945,654 → 24,513 points)
   - **Currently loaded by the application** ✅

2. **us-national-parks.geojson** (23 KB)
   - Point geometries for 63 national parks
   - Lightweight reference data

3. **Individual site files** (~500 bytes each)
   - 71 individual conservation sites
   - **Currently loaded by the application** ✅

## Verification

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Build successful (1.78s)
# ✅ dist folder created without PADUS3 files
# ✅ Simplified geojson files included in dist
```

### Lint Test
```bash
npm run lint
# ✅ No linting errors
```

### File Validation
```bash
# ✅ us-national-parks-polygons.geojson: Valid JSON (62 features)
```

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- Repository size: Includes ~20.5 MB of source files
- Clone time: Slower due to large files
- Deployment: Larger repository to transfer
- Storage: Higher storage requirements

### After Fix
- Repository size: **Reduced by ~20.5 MB**
- Clone time: **Faster** (20.5 MB less to download)
- Deployment: **Faster** (smaller repo to transfer)
- Storage: **Lower** storage requirements

### Application Performance
- **No change** - Application never loaded the PADUS3 files
- Application loads only simplified geojson files (already optimized)
- All existing functionality preserved

## How to Regenerate PADUS3 Files (If Needed)

If developers need to download PADUS3 source files:

1. **Download PADUS3 source files:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/fetch-padus-boundaries.cjs
   ```

2. **Source files will be downloaded to** `public/data/geojson/` but won't be committed due to `.gitignore`

## Best Practices Established

1. **Source files excluded from repository** - Large source files should not be committed
2. **Documentation updated** - README clearly indicates which files are included/excluded
3. **Scripts provided** - Developers can easily regenerate data if needed
4. **Simplified files included** - Production-ready files remain in repository

## Files Changed

- Modified: `.gitignore` - Added PADUS3 exclusion pattern
- Modified: `public/data/geojson/README.md` - Updated PADUS3 documentation
- Deleted: `public/data/geojson/PADUS3_0Designation_StateMO.json`
- Deleted: `public/data/geojson/PADUS3_0Easement_StateMO.json`
- Deleted: `public/data/geojson/PADUS3_0Proclamation_StateMO.json`

## Conclusion

The performance issue was caused by large source files being committed to the repository. These files were not needed for the application to function and have been removed. The repository is now ~20.5 MB smaller, resulting in faster clone times and lower storage requirements, with no impact on application functionality.
