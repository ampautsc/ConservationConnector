### Configuring User Feedback

The feedback mechanism requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to submit feedback to the repository. To enable this feature:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "ConservationConnector Feedback")
   - Select the **"repo"** scope
   - Generate the token and copy it

2. **Add the token as a GitHub Secret:**
   - **For production (GitHub Actions):** 
     1. Go to your GitHub repository
     2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
     3. Click "New repository secret"
     4. Name: `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
     5. Value: Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token
     6. Click "Add secret"
   - **For local development:** Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
     ```
     VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
     ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file or expose your GitHub token in code. Always use GitHub Secrets for production deployments.

Without the token configured, the feedback form will still be accessible but will show a warning and disable submission.

## Usage

1. **View Existing Areas**: The map loads with pre-existing conservation areas displayed as blue circles
2. **Toggle Layers**: Use checkboxes in the toolbox to show/hide conservation areas and heat map
3. **Add New Area**:
   - Enter an optional name for the area
   - Adjust the radius slider (5-200 km)
   - Click "Click Map to Add Area" button
   - Click anywhere on the map to place the new area
   - The area appears as a green circle
4. **Submit Areas**: Click "Submit All New Areas" to download a JSON file with your additions
5. **Send Feedback**: Click the üí¨ button in the bottom-right corner to provide feedback
6. **Zoom**: Use +/- buttons or mouse wheel to zoom from world to street level

## Data Structure

### Simple Format (conservation-areas.json)

Conservation areas are stored in `public/data/conservation-areas.json` with the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique-id",
    "name": "Area Name",
    "lat": 44.4280,
    "lng": -110.5885,
    "radius": 50000,
    "description": "Area description"
  }
]
```

### Detailed Site Data

Comprehensive conservation site data is managed through:
- **Schema**: `public/data/schema/conservation-site-schema.json` - JSON Schema defining site data structure
- **Inventory**: `public/data/sites/INVENTORY.md` - Master list of sites (human-editable)
- **Site Files**: `public/data/sites/*.json` - Individual JSON files for each site (auto-generated)
- **Crawler**: Automated GitHub Action that generates site files from the inventory

See [CONSERVATION_SITE_CRAWLER.md](CONSERVATION_SITE_CRAWLER.md) for details on the conservation site data system.
