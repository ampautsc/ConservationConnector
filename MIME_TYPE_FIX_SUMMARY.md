# MIME Type Fix Summary

## Problem
JavaScript files were being served as HTML with incorrect MIME types, causing the browser to refuse to execute them. The error typically appeared as:
- "Refused to execute script because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable"
- JavaScript files returning HTTP 200 but with HTML content (index.html) instead of actual JavaScript

## Root Cause
The Azure Static Web Apps SPA fallback (`navigationFallback`) was rewriting ALL requests (including asset URLs) to `index.html`. When the browser requested `/assets/index-CJ31Ym5B.js`, Azure was returning the content of `index.html` instead of the actual JavaScript file.

This happened because the `exclude` list was too narrow - it only excluded `/assets/*` and `/data/*`, but Azure's pattern matching wasn't working as expected, or there were edge cases where assets weren't being properly excluded.

## Solution
Expanded the `navigationFallback.exclude` list to be comprehensive and explicit, following Azure Static Web Apps best practices:

### Changes to `staticwebapp.config.json`:

#### 1. Comprehensive File Extension Exclusions
```json
"/*.{css,js,mjs,map,json,ico,png,jpg,jpeg,svg,webp,woff,woff2,ttf,otf,wasm,txt}"
```
This ensures that any file in the root with these extensions is served as-is and not rewritten to index.html.

#### 2. Standard Path Exclusions
```json
"/api/*",
"/favicon.ico",
"/robots.txt",
"/sitemap.xml",
"/static/*",
"/_next/*"
```
These are common paths that should never be rewritten to the SPA entry point.

#### 3. Additional MIME Type Mappings
```json
".webmanifest": "application/manifest+json",
".wasm": "application/wasm",
".map": "application/json"
```
Added mappings for modern web assets that might not have default MIME types in Azure.

## Why This Works

1. **Prevents Fallback Rewriting**: The exclude list now explicitly prevents the SPA fallback from intercepting requests to actual files.

2. **Multiple Layers of Protection**: The configuration now has:
   - Exclude patterns for the fallback
   - Explicit route rules with headers
   - MIME type mappings

3. **Follows Azure Best Practices**: This configuration matches the recommended setup from Azure documentation and community solutions.

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:

1. **Check Network Tab**: In browser DevTools, verify JavaScript files:
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Content-Type: `text/javascript; charset=UTF-8`
   - Response body is JavaScript code (not HTML)

2. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) or use incognito mode

3. **Check Configuration Deployed**: Visit `https://[your-app].azurestaticapps.net/staticwebapp.config.json` to confirm the new configuration is live

4. **Wait for CDN**: Azure CDN may cache old responses for 5-10 minutes

## Expected Outcome

✅ JavaScript files served with correct MIME type  
✅ Browser executes module scripts successfully  
✅ Application loads and displays properly  
✅ No MIME type errors in console
